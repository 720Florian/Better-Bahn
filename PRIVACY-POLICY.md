# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** December 20, 2025

## Introduction

Better Bahn ("Besser Bahn") is a free and open-source application that helps users find cheaper split-ticket options for Deutsche Bahn (German Railway) connections. This privacy policy explains how the app handles your data.

**Source Code:** [https://github.com/chukfinley/Besser-Bahn](https://github.com/chukfinley/Besser-Bahn)

## Data Collection

**Better Bahn does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.** The app operates entirely on your device.

### What data the app processes locally

- **DB Links:** URLs from bahn.de that you paste into the app to analyze train connections
- **User preferences:** Your settings such as age, BahnCard type, and Deutschland-Ticket status

All this data is processed locally on your device and is never sent to any server operated by the developer.

### Network requests

The app makes direct requests from your device to `bahn.de` to retrieve train schedule and pricing information. These requests are made directly from your device to Deutsche Bahn's servers, simulating what a web browser would do. The developer has no access to these requests or any data exchanged.

**There is no central server or backend.** This design choice was made intentionally to:
1. Protect user privacy
2. Avoid centralized data collection
3. Distribute network load across individual users

## Data Storage

All user preferences and settings are stored locally on your device. The app does not use cloud storage, analytics services, or any form of remote data storage.

## Third-Party Services

Better Bahn does not integrate any:
- Analytics or tracking services
- Advertising networks
- Crash reporting services
- Social media SDKs

The only external communication is directly with `bahn.de` to fetch train and pricing data.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data.

## Children's Privacy

Better Bahn does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.

## Open Source

Better Bahn is free and open-source software (FOSS). The complete source code is available on GitHub, allowing anyone to verify the app's behavior and privacy practices:
